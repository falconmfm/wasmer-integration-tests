# Enterprise Architecture Design: Pay Me, Please

### **1. Requirements Analysis**

- **Data Type**: Metrics from Edge servers, including HTTP requests, CPU/memory/network/disk usage.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Not Real-Time**: Data does not need instant availability.
  - **High Accuracy**: Critical for billing purposes.
  - **Low Data Loss Tolerance**: Ensures financial integrity.
- **System Goals**:
  - Scalable collection, transmission, and storage of metrics.
  - Fault tolerance and resilience.
  - Cost efficiency.

### **2. Proposed Architecture**

#### **2.1 Data Collection**

1. **Edge Server Agents**:
   - **Tool**: Prometheus Node Exporter or custom metrics agent.
   - **Reason**: Lightweight, extensible, and supports metrics scraping at regular intervals.
   - **Process**: Agents scrape and buffer metrics locally, compressing data to reduce transmission overhead.

#### **2.2 Data Transmission**

1. **Message Queue**:
   - **Tool**: Apache Kafka.
   - **Reason**:
     - High throughput and low latency for streaming metrics.
     - Strong support for exactly-once delivery and partitioning for scalability.
   - **Process**:
     - Metrics from Edge Server Agents are batched and published to Kafka topics.
     - Kafka ensures durability and acts as a buffer for downstream processing.

#### **2.3 Data Processing**

1. **Stream Processing**:
   - **Tool**: Apache Flink.
   - **Reason**:
     - Advanced capabilities for stateful stream processing and event-time handling.
     - High scalability and integration with Kafka.
   - **Process**:
     - Flink consumes data from Kafka topics, applies filtering and aggregation logic, and prepares the data for billing calculations.
     - Checkpointing and state recovery ensure fault tolerance.

#### **2.4 Billing Engine**

1. **Tool**: Zuora.
   - **Reason**:
     - Designed for subscription billing and complex pricing models.
     - Robust APIs for integration with Flink outputs.
   - **Process**:
     - Aggregated metrics are sent from Flink to Zuora via REST APIs or message queues.
     - Zuora handles invoice generation, subscription management, and payment processing.

#### **2.5 Data Storage**

1. **Cold Storage**:
   - **Tool**: Amazon S3.
   - **Reason**: Cost-effective, highly durable, and ideal for archiving historical metrics.
   - **Process**:
     - Processed and raw data are periodically archived in S3 for compliance and auditing purposes.

2. **Hot Storage**:
   - **Tool**: Amazon DynamoDB or Google Bigtable.
   - **Reason**: Fast query capabilities for recent metrics.
   - **Process**:
     - Metrics required for immediate billing cycles are stored for quick access.

#### **2.6 Monitoring and Alerts**

1. **Monitoring**:
   - **Tool**: Prometheus or Grafana.
   - **Reason**: End-to-end observability of the system.
   - **Process**:
     - Monitors Kafka, Flink, and Zuora components to ensure system health and detect anomalies.

#### **2.7 Failure Scenarios and Mitigations**

| **Failure**             | **Mitigation**                                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Edge Agent Failure      | Local caching of metrics; retries on transmission.         |
| Kafka Downtime          | Multi-node Kafka clusters and replication ensure availability. |
| Flink Failure           | Checkpointing and state recovery minimize data loss.       |
| Zuora Downtime          | Retry mechanisms for failed API calls.                    |
| Storage Unavailability  | Multi-region replication for S3 and DynamoDB.             |

### **3. Trade-offs**

#### **Cost vs. Performance**
- **Cold Storage**: Lower costs but slower access times.
- **Hot Storage**: Higher costs but supports rapid queries.

#### **Managed vs. Self-Managed**
- Kafka and Flink require operational expertise if self-managed, but offer fine-grained control.
- Zuora simplifies billing logic but comes with subscription costs.

### **4. Recovery Objectives**

- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 5 minutes.
  - Metrics loss limited to the last batch if a catastrophic failure occurs.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 30 minutes.
  - Service should be fully operational within 30 minutes of a failure.

### **5. Cost Analysis**

| **Component**            | **Estimated Cost (Monthly)** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Edge Agents              | Negligible.                 |
| Message Queue (Kafka)    | $200 (self-hosted); $500 (managed). |
| Stream Processing (Flink)| $300 (self-hosted).          |
| Billing Engine (Zuora)   | Depends on subscription model. |
| Cold Storage (S3)        | $20 per TB.                 |
| Hot Storage (DynamoDB)   | $50 per TB.                 |
| Monitoring               | $100.                       |
| **Total**                | **Varies**                  |

### **6. Final Architecture Diagram**

```
[Edge Server Agents] -> [Apache Kafka] -> [Apache Flink] -> [Zuora Billing Engine]
     Monitoring & Alerts <-       Metrics Data Flow       -> [Cold Storage / Hot Storage]
```

This architecture focuses on leveraging Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Zuora to create a robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant billing system suitable for various business needs.
